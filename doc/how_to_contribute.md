# How To Contribute

  1. Run `pip install ./src/` in Aipen's root folder.
  2. Create a branch off of master with a name describing the changes
  you intend to make.
  3. On the new branch, write code and relevant tests in the testing
  folder.
  4. Commit as you go, ensuring that code in every commit can be run
  without exiting due to an eror, though the functionality may be
  partial.
  5. When the change is complete, push your branch and open a pull
  request on Github.
