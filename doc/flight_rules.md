# Flight Rules

  * __Be [Pythonic](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/).__
  * Use a virtual environment.
  * Write _comprehensive_ tests before commiting your code.
  * [Do not repeat yourself](https://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html)
  * Do _not_ manage branches and merging in `git`, use GitHub instead.
  * If the build fails but runs locally, you may have forgotten to
  include new dependencies in `setup.py`.

## Style Conventions

This list will expand as needed.

We use standard Python conventions to make code consistent across the
repository, making it easier to read, debug, and compare to other
code at a glance.

  1. When naming variables, it is better to be verbose than ambiguous.
  2. Use underscores and lowercase for `file_names`, `function_names`,
  and `variable_names`.
  3. Use camel case for `ClassNames`.
