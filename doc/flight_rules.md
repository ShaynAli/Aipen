# Flight Rules

  * __Be [Pythonic](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/).__
  * Use a virtual environment.
  * Write _comprehensive_ tests before commiting your code.
  * [Do not repeat yourself](https://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html)
  * Do _not_ manage branches and merging in `git`, use GitHub instead.
  * If the build fails but runs locally, you may have forgotten to
  include new dependencies in `setup.py`.
